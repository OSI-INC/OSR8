# OSR8
Open Source Reconfigurable Eight-Bit Processor (OSR8)

The OSR8 is an open-source, reconfigurable eight-bit processor described in VHDL (virtual hardware description language) for implementation in programmable logic devices. The processor is designed to be small and energy-efficient. We want the OSR8 to fit in the logic chip we have available on a small battery-powered circuit, and we want it to perform calculations with the minimum energy consumed from the battery. When we implement the The OSR8V1 with 16Ã—1-bit look-up tables (LUTs), as in the MachXO2 Family of programmable logic devices, the OSR8V1 occupies 800 LUTs.
